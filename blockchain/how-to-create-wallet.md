# How to Create a Liberland Blockchain Wallet Using the Polkadot.js Browser Extension

## Introduction

The Liberland blockchain uses a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which makes it environmentally friendly to operate. Anyone can participate as a Nominator, while only citizens can run Validators, providing an additional layer of security against bad actors. As a nation-state whose entire governance and legislation is managed on-chain, Liberland offers non-citizens the ability to help secure the blockchain by staking LLD through the nomination of Validators who run the infrastructure for the blockchain. Nominating a good Validator leads to learning LLD, while bad Validators and their Nominators can have their LLD stakes slashed. This leads to better blockchain security and incentivizes being a good Validator and Nominator. 

Built using Parity Substrate, the same technology that powers the Polkadot ecosystem, the Liberland Blockchain benefits from some cross-compatibility with existing frameworks and tools. [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) is a browser extension that allows you to interact with the Liberland Blockchain and other blockchain networks directly from your browser. In this guide, we will show you how to create a wallet using Polkadot.js browser extension.
