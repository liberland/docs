## Outline
## Citizenship & Political Pooling
### Explanation
At Liberland, we value freedom and commitment, and that's exactly what we expect from our citizens. The pathway to citizenship is easy to navigate and doesn't require intensive time or civic knowledge tests, unlike traditional states. Instead, we have a straightforward process that includes a voluntary tax payment. This approach establishes a commitment link between our state and our prospective citizens.

While we've kept the voluntary tax payment reasonable, we also ensure it's significant enough to demonstrate your dedication to our cause.

To maintain the integrity of our libertarian state, we have implemented a basic Know Your Customer (KYC) check. This check is designed along the lines of commercial sector practices. Once you clear these procedures, we'll notify you of your successful citizenship via email.

As part of your journey towards becoming a Liberland citizen, you will gain access to 5000 Liberland Merit (LLM), a requirement for engaging in our unique political environment. Despite your contribution, the value remains yours. Unlike other states, your contribution still belongs to you. You can gradually withdraw it or exchange it for other currencies at a rate of 10% per year. This system is our version of social security. However, while withdrawing, you won't be able to participate in elections or referenda, though you can still hold political offices.

## Direct Democracy
### Explanation
The fundamental democratic process in the Free Republic of Liberland is established upon the principles of citizen-based referendums. Each and every law must be approved through this democratic referendum, and likewise, any law removal is also dictated by the same process. Citizens participate in this referendum using their LLM tokens.

Proposals for new laws can be initiated either by the general public or by Congress. In the instance of a law being proposed by the citizenry, its approval is subjected to a dynamic voting requirement calculation. This strategic mechanism is intended to prevent the opportunistic adoption of laws contrary to the wishes of the silent majority, particularly in situations of low voter turnout. As such, when voter turnout is lower, the quantity of LLM required for a law to be passed increases. Conversely, higher voter turnout results in a lower LLM requirement, reaching a simple majority when voter turnout is at 100 percent.

In addition, Liberland has a distinct referendum type known as the Public Veto, in which each citizen is granted one vote. The primary function of the Public Veto is to enable the removal of legislative measures and officials from their respective positions.

## Representative Democracy
### Explanation
The representative democracy of Liberland serves as an auxiliary mechanism, supplementing the foundational direct democratic process. The central component of this representative system is the Congress, which is re-elected every three months by the full citizenship through the use of their LLM votes. Should a previously active voter abstain in a subsequent election, their last vote is preserved and carried forward to all future elections until a different voting decision is made.

The existence of Congress is founded on two primary objectives:

1. The first responsibility of Congress is the proposal of laws for referendum, akin to the power that resides with the general public. However, unlike proposals from the populace, the proposals made by Congress are not subject to the anti-populist measure. Instead, they invariably require a simple majority to be approved. This distinction is made due to the inherent democratic legitimacy conferred upon Congress, as it is elected by the LLM holders. Additionally, Congress is presumed to have a high level of competence as a dedicated legislative body.

2. The second key function of Congress is to serve as the principal focus for vote delegation. If voters feel that they lack adequate knowledge to comprehend certain issues on which a referendum is conducted, they have the option to voluntarily delegate their vote. Voters are at liberty to place their trust in their representative in Congress or any other citizen, granting them the authority to vote on their behalf in the referendum. This delegation of voting rights is not binding and can be retracted at any time for any reason as per the discretion of the voter.
