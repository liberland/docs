# How to Acquire LLD

There are multiple ways to acquire LLD. 
If you already have LLD on other chains like Ethereum or Solana, check out the [Bridging guide](./cross-chain-bridge.md).

The easiest way to get LLDs currently are to use one of the centralized exchanges where selling USDT for LLD is possible.

In brief, the process is as follows:

- Create a wallet using [Subwallet](https://subwallet.app), [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz), Polkadotjs, or [Edge Wallet](https://edge.app)
  - Note: Edge Wallet does **not connect to applications** and is best used for cold storage of LLD
- Acquire LLD, withdraw them to your wallet
- Go to [Liberland Blockchain dApp](https://blockchain.liberland.org) 
- Go to Staking
- Choose a validator to nominate, and update your nominations

LLD purchased on other chains like Ethereum, Solana, or TRON can be bridged to [Liberland Blockchain using HASHI Bridge](./cross-chain-bridge.md).
