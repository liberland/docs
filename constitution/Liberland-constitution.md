> Notice: this is NOT a final version of Constitution, it is just a draft!

*We, the Citizens of the Free Republic of Liberland, in order to secure Life, Liberty, and Property, for ourselves and future generations, do ordain and establish the Constitution of the Free Republic of Liberland, attempting a harmonious consensus for the benefit of all those seeking their home in this place. Being aware of a long and shameful list of governments’ trespasses to the Rights of the people, we hereby declare that the Public Authority governing the Free Republic of Liberland shall first and foremost respect the Bill of Rights and exercise only such functions as have been delegated to it under this Constitution.
