## Preface

I, Vit Jedlicka, the first President of Liberland, being so empowered by § 11 of the Articles of the Provisional government of the Republic of Liberland, hereby order the Provisional Government of Liberland and all her ministers to regularly enact and publish the Cabinet's Decisions as outlined in this Order.

## The Order

#### Art. 1: The publishing of Cabinet Decisions

§ 1

During a Cabinet meeting, where the Cabinet shall decide upon a matter, and it is accepted or rejected, that act shall constitute a Decision of the Cabinet.

§ 2

The Minister of Justice shall be responsible for publishing these Decisions of the Cabinet in a regular manner on the official publication website of Liberland.

#### Art. 2: The publishing form

§ 1

The Minister of Justice shall prepare the form which the Cabinet shall use as the regular manner of publishing their Decisions. In addition to Decisions, this form shall contain: a) the date of the meeting of the Cabinet; b) the number of the Cabinet Meeting in question, restarting at the beginning of every calendar year; b) the program of the meeting of the Cabinet; c) any other significant matters upon which the Cabinet has agreed but which should not have the character of Decisions, which distinction I leave in the hands of the Cabinet.

§ 2

Any amendments to this form, its rewriting and reworking I with this rest by the Minister of Justice.

#### Art. 3: Sensitive information

§ 1

1. Under exceptional circumstances where this publication should seriously endanger the future or the reputation of Liberland, the Cabinet shall ask me for an exception and should I grant it, the Cabinet shall not publish the Decision immediately. The Cabinet shall postpone the publication.
2. Such Decisions shall still be set in writing in the same regular manner as other Decisions, but not in any public space. The Minister of Justice shall keep it in safe storage.
3. These Decisions shall be published as soon as possible after the reason for the delay of their publication has passed.

§ 2

Where the publication of a Decision shall be postponed, so shall the publication of any other information regarding that Decision. This includes its mention of the government's program and other significant matters upon which the Cabinet has agreed regarding the subject matter of that Decision but which should not have the character of a Decision.

§ 3

I leave in the hands of the Cabinet whether they should set for such Decisions and related information a placeholder, as in writing 'Classified', or whether they should refrain from publishing it without any such a mention.

#### Art. 4: Legal force

This Order shall be immediately binding to the Cabinet and all its ministers.
